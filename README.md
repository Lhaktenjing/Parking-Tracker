# Parking-Tracker
A smarter solution to the Parking and traffic problem using NbIot
## Inspiration: Traffic Congestion has been one of the major challenges of big cities in the World including Seattle. From a service provider/government's point of view, it is an issue of concern because of the challenge in managing the huge flow of traffic resulting in inefficient service distribution. A study shows that almost up to 30% of the traffic in a city at a given time are drivers looking for parking spaces. And from a consumer's perspective, it will be a lifesaver as they will be able to access the availability of parking spaces hugely reducing the time and the stress they have to deal with. In addition, the ability to manipulate your payment and time duration benefits users from paying extra money or fines that might show up. And most importantly, it'll be a huge aid for the parking enforcement department as it reduces unnecessary patrolling saving a huge amount of budget is saved. Which can be invested in other sectors.

## What it does: 
For consumers: It sends users detailed information of location and available parking spaces near him/her. Help keep track of the his/her parked car. Manage payments and parking duration.

For Government/Service Provider: Keep track of parking space use up. See unauthorized parking or violation of law. Bill customers  


## How we built it:
Used ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of a car in the space.
NbIot technology to send and receive data over SMS and cloud
Arduino
